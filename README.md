# Timely

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.6.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install all dependencys.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run server` to start json-server. It starts on `http://localhost:4200/`.


Things to add/change:
  - functionality to edit button (right now it's just there to look nice)
  - live timer when clicking start button
  - arrange items in table
  - add export table button
  - real back end server
  - saving start time on server (so you can hit F5 or restart browser and not lose progress)
  - project duration counter is limited to 24 hours (for aesthetics)
